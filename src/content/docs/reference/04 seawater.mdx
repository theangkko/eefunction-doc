Seawater is a seawater property calculation function developed by MIT.   
It uses temperature, pressure, and salinity as input parameters to provide various property values.

**Operating Ranges**
- Temperature: 0 to 180°C
- Pressure: 0 to 120 bar.a
- Salinity: 0 to 120 g/kg

**Seawater function UNIT**

import TableSeawater from './TableSeawater.astro';

<TableSeawater />

_**Notes**_
- All functions accept temperature in Celsius, pressure in bar absolute, and salinity in grams per kilogram
- Reference states (T0, S0, P0) are required for flow exergy calculations
- Functions are based on the MIT seawater thermodynamic property library
- Properties are calculated using the IAPWS Industrial Formulation
