GERG2008 is an international standard equation for calculating properties of natural gas and other gas mixtures. This module can calculate various thermodynamic properties such as density, compression factor, enthalpy, and heat capacity, and is particularly suitable for accurate property calculations of industrial gases such as natural gas, hydrogen, and nitrogen.

**Operating Ranges**
- Pressure: 0 to 350 bara
- Temperature: -183°C to 277°C
- Valid ranges may vary depending on the gas mixture composition

**Gas Functions**

import TableGas from './TableGas.astro';

<TableGas />

**Fluid Name Format**
- The fluid name should be provided as a string specifying the gas mixture composition
- Example format: "CH4:0.94,C2H6:0.05,CO2:0.01" represents a mixture of:
  - 94% Methane (CH4)
  - 5% Ethane (C2H6)
  - 1% Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
- Components must sum to 1.0 (100%)
- Supported components include: CH4 (Methane), C2H6 (Ethane), C3H8 (Propane), N2 (Nitrogen), CO2 (Carbon Dioxide), and others per GERG2008 standard

**Notes**
- Temperature is optional parameter for `LHV` and `HHV` calculations
- Temperature defaults to 25°C if not provided for `LHV` and `HHV`
- Temperature must be provided for all other functions
