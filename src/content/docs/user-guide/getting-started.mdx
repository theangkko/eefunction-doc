### How to Use
In addition to Excel's built-in functions, you need to use VBA to add user-defined functions (UDF).
Office Add-ins also provide functionality similar to VBA using the `Javascript API`. This is called **Custom Functions**, and eeFunction is a collection of such functions.

For simple usage instructions, please refer to the video below.

Just like Excel's built-in functions, you can use Custom Functions by entering `=` in the function input box (fx). When you start typing the function name, you'll see a list of available functions.
For example, even if you just type `=air`, all functions that include "air" in their name will be displayed.

import image_ee010 from '../../../assets/eefunction/230531_ee010InputFunction.jpg';

<Image src={image_ee010} alt="" width="500" />
{/* ![](../../../assets/eefunction/230531_ee010InputFunction.jpg)   */}

{/* <img src="../../../assets/eefunction/230531_ee010InputFunction.jpg" width="400" height="300" />     */}
{/* <Image src={"../../../assets/eefunction/230531_ee010InputFunction.jpg"} alt="" width="400" height="300"/> */}
 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   
Using the function auto-complete feature, you can quickly enter functions without typing the entire function name. After typing `=air`, select the function you want to use with the up/down arrow keys. Then press the `TAB` key to complete the rest.

{/* <img src="../../../../assets/eefunction/230531_ee011InputFunction.jpg" width="300" height="300" /> */}
{/* ![](../../../../assets/eefunction/230531_ee011InputFunction.jpg)     */}

import image_ee011 from '../../../assets/eefunction/230531_ee011InputFunction.jpg';

<Image src={image_ee011} alt="" width="350" />

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


To see a list of **all available functions** in eeFunction, type `=ee.`.   

{/* ![](../../../../assets/eefunction/230531_ee012InputFunction.jpg)    */}
{/* <img src="../../../../assets/eefunction/230531_ee012InputFunction.jpg" width="500px" height="300px" /> */}

import image_ee012 from '../../../assets/eefunction/230531_ee012InputFunction.jpg';

<Image src={image_ee012} alt="" width="650" />
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

To view detailed descriptions and help, click (fx) in the function input box and select **eeFunction** from the category selection to see the function list and detailed descriptions of each function.
